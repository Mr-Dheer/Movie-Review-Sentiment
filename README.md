### The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, originally collected by Pang and Lee [1]. 

### In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus. This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. I have  labeled phrases on a scale of five values:
### negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive.
### Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.

### The sentiment labels are:

- 0 - negative
- 1 - somewhat negative
- 2 - neutral
- 3 - somewhat positive
- 4 - positive
